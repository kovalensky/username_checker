# How to use

Go to releases, download the build, change config.toml to your variables, run the checker from cli.

"mask" is a piece of text on t.me/profile it could be a status, or name.

Background mode is activated via this:
```bash
checker.exe hide
```

This is not a claimer, but rather deletion status checker for unpopular usernames.
